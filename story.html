                <article>
                    <h4>1873, Lincoln County, Nevada, United States of America.</h4>

                    </figure>
                    <p> In a secret hideout just outside of the town of Dry Valley, notorious outlaws J.J. Jackson and his little brother V.P. 
                        Jackson are double-checking the plans for robbing the local bank.
                    </p>
                    <p>Next morning, as J.J. wakes up, he notices that V.P. is gone with the plan. Thanks to his lousy memory, J.J.
                         can’t remember the plan clearly, and the only thing he remembers is the bank. Puzzled, he sets out to the bank 
                         hoping that it would refresh his memory. Upon entering the bank, J.J. notices that the safe is empty and the whole place 
                         is crawling with deputies. Amidst all the confusion, J.J. hears familiar footsteps behind him and swiftly turns around. From 
                         a short distance away stands the imposing figure of Dry Valley’s sheriff, O.P. Johnson. Alerted by seeing J.J.’s face, the 
                         sheriff comes to a halt and his hand automatically reaches for the revolver on his waist.
                    </p>
                    <p>“What are you doing here, Jackson!?” shouts Johnson, to which the completely oblivious J.J. answers
                        </p>
                        <p>  “I’m looking for my little brother V.P. Have you seen him, by any chance?”
                            </p>
                            <p> “I haven’t, but I’m taking you in for armed robbery. Cuff him, boys!”
                                </p>
                                <p> Suddenly, J.J. is surrounded by deputies, who quickly take him to custody.
                            
                    </p>
                    <p> As the deputies are escorting J.J. towards his cell, he trips on his sandals and falls face down on the cold, 
                        rocky floor, knocking himself out. A few hours later, J.J. wakes up to people talking about the robbery. After some trouble, J.J. manages to break out and secures himself a horse and makes his escape. 
                        He then sets his course towards Arizona, where he suspects V.P. might have gone.

                    <p>Having crossed the border to Arizona, he finds a small town. He enters the saloon in hopes of finding
                            someone who might know of V.P.’s whereabouts. The bartender mentions having seen someone riding
                            towards the Indian village. J.J. quickly continues his journey to find his brother.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>  After a long ride, he finally reaches the Indian village. Parched, he asks around for some water in order
                            to hydrate himself. The tribesmen point in the direction of the biggest teepee where J.J. immediately
                            heads to. Inside, he finds the village chief, who offers J.J. a bottle of clear liquid, just like J.J. ordered.
                            Hastily downing the drink, J.J. begins to feel the effects and starts to rejuvenate. He asks the chief about
                            V.P. The chief tells J.J. that V.P. hired one of the tribe’s member to guide him across the wilderness.
                            Heading to the direction shown by the chief, J.J. eventually finds a sole Indian who’s surrounded by wild
                            beasts, with no V.P. around. J.J. distracts the beasts in order to save the Indian guide, and they
                            successfully return to the village. As thanks for saving the guide, the village chief directs J.J. to an old
                            shaman who could help J.J. find his brother.

                        </p>
                        <p>  Arriving at the mountain where the shaman is located, J.J. asks the shaman whether he knows about
                            V.P. Before the shaman offers to help J.J., he tells him that the only way he can find V.P. is with the use
                            of magic mushrooms and their consciousness-altering qualities. J.J. manages to find the mushrooms
                            and swiftly delivers them to the shaman. With the help of the mushrooms, the shaman has visions which
                            show that V.P.’s location is in an abandoned mine, but in order to get to him, J.J. must first cross the vast
                            desert.

                        </p>
                        <p>   After crossing the harsh desert, J.J. eventually winds up at the abandoned mine mentioned by the
                            shaman. With no V.P. in sight, he starts walking down the mine shaft. Stumbling around in the dark, J.J.
                            finally notices some light at the end of a tunnel, and begins walking towards it. At the source of the light
                            he finds V.P. sitting in front of a campfire, counting his money. Alerted by J.J.’s presence, V.P. jumps to
                            the air.

                        </p>
                        <p>  “What are you doing here, Julle!?” V.P. asks, while his hand rests on the holster.
                            </p>
                            <p>   “I was looking for you all around, Vellu, why did you leave me behind?”
                                </p>
                                <p>  The two then engage in a heated standoff, waiting for the other to make his move. After a few minutes,
                            the tense atmosphere comes to an end with only one the guns having gone off. In the end, J.J. prevails.
                            He collects the money and rides into the horizon with the setting sun painting the sky with a reddish hue.
