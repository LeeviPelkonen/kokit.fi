# kokit.fi

As HANHiPASi we created a web-application Kokit.fi It targets home chefs and food enthusiasts with easy access to sharing and learning new recipes with each other. To launch the application you need to open the index.html file and start index.js with Node. We are using a MySQL-database. To configure your own database, create a .env-file and configure it by referring to the dotenv-documentation. The application is designed mobile-first, but is functional on a larger screen. 

NPM Dependencies needed:
  - npm Express
  - npm express-session
  - npm passport-local
  - npm body-parser
  - npm passport
  - npm mysql
  - npm sharp
  - npm multer
  - npm dotenv
